Scala solutions to Programming Praxis exercises
===============================================

[Programming Praxis](https://programmingpraxis.com/) is a great
website. Check it out.

I started doing these exercises to kill time during a long flight
layover and thought I might as well put them on github for others who
are curious about what simple code in Scala looks like.

Because these exercises are just a way for me to learn the Scala
language and libraries, I've tended to focus on correctness
(i.e. getting stuff to work right) rather than efficiency. I try to
write things in a functional style that is as idiomatic as I know how.

Everything here is a work in progress!
